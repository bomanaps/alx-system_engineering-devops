Upon the unveiling of ALX School's System Engineering & DevOps project 0x19 at approximately 00:07 Pacific Standard Time (PST), an outage transpired within an isolated Ubuntu 14.04 container running an Apache web server. Requests directed at the server resulted in 500 Internal Server Errors instead of the expected HTML file, defining a simple Holberton WordPress site.

The debugging process commenced at around 19:20 PST when Bug debugger Brennan (BDB—yes, those are my actual initials, quite clever, right?) encountered the issue upon project initiation and received instructions to rectify it. Brennan promptly delved into addressing the problem.

Inspected running processes using 'ps aux,' revealing two apache2 processes—root and www-data—properly functioning.
Examined the sites-available folder in the /etc/apache2/ directory, identifying that the web server served content from /var/www/html/.
Ran 'strace' on the PID of the root Apache process in one terminal while executing a 'curl' on the server in another. Unfortunately, 'strace' provided no valuable information.
Repeated step 3 on the PID of the www-data process, leading to a breakthrough. 'strace' uncovered a -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) error while attempting to access the file /var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp.
Scanned files in the /var/www/html/ directory individually, utilizing Vim pattern matching to locate the erroneous .phpp file extension within the wp-settings.php file (Line 137, require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/class-wp-locale.php' );).
Removed the trailing 'p' from the line, followed by testing another 'curl' on the server, resulting in a 200 A-ok response.
Crafted a Puppet manifest to automate the error-fixing process.
In summary, the issue stemmed from a typo—specifically, the WordPress app encountering a critical error in wp-settings.php due to a misspelled file name (class-wp-locale.phpp instead of class-wp-locale.php). The resolution involved a straightforward correction of the typo by removing the trailing 'p.'

To prevent similar outages in the future, it is emphasized to conduct thorough testing before deployment and implement status monitoring services like UptimeRobot for instant alerts upon website outages.

In response to the error, a Puppet manifest (0-strace_is_your_friend.pp) was developed to automatically rectify identical errors in the future. The manifest replaces any '.phpp' extensions in the file /var/www/html/wp-settings.php with '.php.'

However, as the postmortem humorously concludes, programmers never make errors, ensuring such incidents are unlikely to recur. The narrative resonates with the shared experiences and challenges faced in the field of Software Engineering. Ha ha!
